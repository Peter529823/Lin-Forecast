# Lin-Forecast

The linforecast function performs a one-step-ahead linear forecast of a time series variable y using a set of explanatory variables x. It fits an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model where each value of y (from time 2 onwards) is predicted using the values of x from the previous time step. The function estimates the regression coefficients (b), computes the forecasts (fy), and calculates residuals (e). From these, it derives standard error estimates, with the option to use robust methods such as Newey-West or White corrections if specified by the user via the sterrmethod argument. Additionally, it computes various model performance metrics including adjusted R-squared, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Theil’s U-statistic (U), which compares the forecast’s performance to a naive benchmark. The output also includes the t-statistics for each coefficient, which indicate their statistical significance. This function is commonly used in time series forecasting contexts like financial return prediction, where evaluating and comparing forecast accuracy is crucial.
